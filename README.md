# Three.js

Three.js is an open-source JavaScript library that you can use to create dynamic and interactive websites with 2D and 3D graphics. With Three.js, you can render 3D graphics directly inside the browser. You can do fantastic stuff using Three.js by adding animations or logic and even turning your website into a game. Ricardo Cabello (or mrdoob in GitHub) released Three.js in 2010 and maintained a great open-source community.
